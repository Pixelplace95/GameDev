[How Small Open-World Games Feel Big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3cPJL4ISlU)
*How space is being use*
*Leave it when they want it more*
# Small games
* Makes more unique the things we want to show to the player 
* The player know they have the time to do all the things, quest, coleccionables, etc. 
* Make posible the player navigate alone thanks of its own knowledge 
* Movement in interesting ways, leave behind a reminiscent in the memory of the player  
* New way in the world to briefly interact with it 
# Big games
* Big worlds tend to repeat over and over same ideas again and again 
* The rewards for doing these things became less necessary once i the player progressed or level up their character 
*Didn't feel worth it*
* Overwhelm the player with all the things they need to do
