# Taught
Introducing its concept in a safe environment 
# Development
Reinforce what we taught
# Twisted
Toward the end of each stage the concept is turned on its head in some way, to either challenge your mastery or to make you think about it from a fresh perspective 

# Conclusion 
Each level gives you one last chance to show off your skills
