[Spatial Communication in Level Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeUZVikPV8) 

# Block-Out / Gray Box
- Communicates important game play information to your team 
- Gets to a playable state as quickly as possible 
- Simple structure
	For quick iteration 
# Present a Clear Objective
* Removes blank canvas syndrome
	Helps to not feel overwhelm
* Helps set up sightlines
* Clear objective
# Motivate movement
- Block players sightlines
- Make them move around to gather information 
	- Engaging 
	- Mental-Map
	- Jigsaw-menal map puzles
	If we didn't make the spaces interesting 
	The Feel turns like a liminal-ish
	* Force to piece together a mental map 
# Tear Down te wall
* Still prevents player escaping 
* More visual engaging 
* Opportunities to reinforce the goal 
* Story-telling
* Back tracking
* Information through new perspectives
	* Creates small pockets off tension 
	* Then release the tension in surprising ways 
	* Little hints that guide the player trough te level 
	* Builds a vocabular of patterns that the player instinctively follow
* Keep te player engaged and on their toes 
# One-Way valve
*A no return function*
* Gently nudges the player forward 
* Helps player from getting too lost
* Creates a more manageable play spaces 
# Present a privileged perspective
* Study environment and form a plan safety
* Players pushes forwards wen they are ready
* difficult to learn a layout under stress
# The illusion of choice
* Multiple routes that converge on a single space 
* If the player didn't explore one way it make te feel of the space much larger than it is 
# Attract the player attention 
* Movement will catch te players eye
* Light make te geometry easier to read
	* Contrast
* Sound will draw the player attention 
## Paralaxing environment
* Provide depth cues as te player moves
* Make it easier to judge distance 
* Creates a dynamic image 
## Affordances communicate function
* Doors and arachways afford moving into a new spaces
* Steeps afford climbing
* Recognizable forms like these are strong attractors to players
* Unexpected
# Creating mystery 
(Telling what to do without telling directly)
* Things the player assume exist, but cant see
	* Creates curiosity and mystery
* Door slightly ajar tells the player it can be opened
* Door blocks view so players cant see wat is behind it
# Create Shortcuts
* Allows access to earlier areas even wen using one way valves 
* Players to circumnavigate previous challenges 
* Makes space feel more accessible and believable
# Pinch points
* Control the players movement and therefore their camera
![[Pasted image 20250317182420.png]]
*We know where the player and camera is*
* Show te player something important
* Doesn't take control away from player 
# Build a vocabulary
* Build on ideas that you ave taught the player 
* Use tese ideas to seed plans in players mind 
* Satisfaction in both seeing these plans be subverted or play our as expected 
# Safety nets
* Restarts break immersion and flow 
* keep the player in the game as much as possible 
* Doesn't compromise or undermine challenge 

*Some times an unrealistic place is more believable and less frustrating than a real place*
# Add temporary furniture
* Space feel larger when is empty
* Art will inevitably be added to space 
* Make sure your space is large enough to accommodate bot, gameplay and art 
# Problem, solution ordering 
* Ensure player recognizes the problem before they find a solution 
* Confusing for player if they discovers information out of order
* Can make puzzle feel redundant
# Let the player get lost
* Getting lost creates tension in the player journey 
* Finding where you are again is satisfying
* Constantly knowing where you are kills tension
# Build on uneven terrain 
* Forces interesting architectural compromises 
* Looks more natural and visually interesting 
* Encourages designer to build off grid
