[Every game designer should understand Orthogonal Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW5s5Wb5vo4)

>Helps drastically to make level design easy

Differences in abilities of game entities that are in type rather than in value. One of the uses of having many game entities in games is that they can have different types of abilities. When these abilities and the functionality they provide do not only have quantitative but also qualitative difference this means that the games have Orthogonal Differentiation.

# Defining orthogonal game design

>Instead of having 3 types of cars we can have: Cars, Boats and helicopters

They are not just a matter of number changes, this make the player feel he can do way more things than having only 3 cars 

# Example: DOOM

Enemies 
* Hit scan enemies 
* Proyectiles
* Mele

Orthogonal different enemies 

Your combat chooses relay on the composition in each level of enemies, making a loot of interesting situations for the player

# Example: Dishonored 1

**Abilities**
* Bend time
* Posses
* See trough walls
* Teleportation

Very different abilities which players can combinate an use as they want

# Three levels of knowing 
## Simplicity 
Is the world view of the child or uninformed adult, fully engaged in his own experience and happily unaware of what lies beneath the surface of immediate reality.
## Complexity 
Characterizes the ordinary adult world view. It is characterized by an awareness of complex systems in nature and society but an inability to discern clarifying patterns and connections.
## Informed simplicity 
Is an enlightened view of reality. It is founded upon an ability to discern or create clarifying patterns within complex mixtures. Pattern recognition is a crucial skill for an architect, who must create a highly ordered building amid many competing and frequently nebulous design considerations.
