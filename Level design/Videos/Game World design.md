# Game World Design
Game World design is the process of creation of interactivity in the game as below-
• The Physical environment including terrain, buildings, skybox, objects 
• The missions that have to be completed, by triggers 
• The characters that the player interacts with 
• The environmental obstacles/hazards that the player faces 
• The enemies the player has to overcome
•The sounds that the player trigger 
• The cinematic sequences/cut-scenes that are triggered

# Objectives of Game World Design 
• Provide an appropriate physical environment to play the game (graphics, physics, lighting) 
• Teach the player the skills that she/he needs and give an opportunity to use them 
• Assist in the storytelling by providing a visual and social environment and trigger based flow to story events.
• Provide a richer experience and replay ability by allowing the player to make meaningful choices in the gameplay.
• Guide the player in a way that she/he is being obviously guided.
